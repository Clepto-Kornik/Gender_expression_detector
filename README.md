# Gender_expression_detector

This is real-time image analysis algorithm that, while recognizing the gender of the person appearing on the camera, would additionally enable the detection of a smile. To optimize the results, I compared two approaches: a proprietary convolutional neural network with experimentally selected parameters and a pretreated model using transfer learning. Both approaches showed high accuracy of results.
